This is the website of [Fa1cono](https://github.com/Fa1cono). I like programming and am wanting to look more into C and Java, hire me! (or train me).

## Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/The-Falcon1/The-Falcon1.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
